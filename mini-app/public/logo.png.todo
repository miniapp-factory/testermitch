512x512
A stylized 2048 tile logo featuring a bright, gradient background that transitions from deep blue at the top to vibrant teal at the bottom. In the center, a large, bold number "2048" is displayed in a modern sans-serif font, with each digit slightly rounded and a subtle drop shadow to give depth. Surrounding the number are smaller tiles arranged in a 4x4 grid pattern, each tile containing the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and 2048 in a gradient of colors from light gray to bright orange, creating a sense of progression. The overall composition is clean, with ample white space around the logo, making it suitable for use as an app icon and website header.
